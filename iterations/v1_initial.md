# Design Evolution — v1 (Initial)

Summary

- Objective: derive a secure microservices blueprint and core finance modules from high‑leverage strategic prompts.
- Output: initial system architecture, base DB schema, API contracts at outline level.
- Known gaps at this stage
    - Compliance details were minimal.
    - Security controls (MFA, secrets, encryption at rest) described conceptually, not fully specified.
    - Performance targets noted but not yet linked to test evidence.

Traceability

- Aligns with Breakdown Structure Task and Layer 1 strategic output (architecture first, then data and APIs).[[7]](https://www.notion.so/Breakdown-Structure-Task-279a56ae5817809fb32ac99177639cc1?pvs=21)
