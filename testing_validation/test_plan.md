# Test Plan — Portfolio Summary

Objective

- Validate key artifacts generated by the FPF + Multi‑Layer strategy: quantitative investment logic (MPT, TLH), API contracts, and summarized non‑functional requirements.

Scope

- Quantitative backend: Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Tax‑Loss Harvesting (TLH)
- API contracts: /transactions (GET), /portfolio/optimization (POST), and any additional endpoints defined in docs/API_Specifications.yaml
- Summarized NFRs: p95 ML categorization latency under 500 ms on a simulated dataset

Acceptance Criteria

- MPT: optimal weights sum to 1.0 ± 1e−6 and contain no NaN values
- TLH: a position with current_price < cost_basis is flagged as a loss candidate
- API contracts: responses return 200/202 and payloads include required fields as per the schema
- ML p95 latency (simulated): under 500 ms on a synthetic set of 1k transactions

Test Cases

- test_mpt_weights_sum_to_one
- test_tlh_detects_losses
- test_api_transactions_contract
- test_mlp95_categorization_latency_sim (stubbed simulation)
