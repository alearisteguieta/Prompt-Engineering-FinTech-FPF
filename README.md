## üìù Executive Summary

This project showcases an advanced **Prompt Engineering workflow** developed during an internship at **ZeTheta Algorithim Private Limited**. The core achievement is the successful orchestration of a **Multi-Layer Prompt Strategy** to systematically build the architecture and core financial logic for a **Personal Wealth Management Application** (similar to Mint + Betterment).

The work rigorously follows the **Meta Prompt ‚Üí Financial Prompt Framework (FPF) ‚Üí Multilayer Strategy** sequence, demonstrating traceability, compliance focus (PCI DSS, OAuth 2.0), and the ability to decompose complex FinTech tasks into machine-executable prompt layers.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1.  **Systematic Decomposition:** Apply the **Breakdown Structure Task** methodology to dissect a complex business problem (wealth management, ML, security) into sequential, actionable prompts.
2.  **Architectural Generation:** Use **Prompt Layer 1 (Strategic Architecture Prompting)** to generate a secure and scalable Microservices design with defined SLA and latency metrics (e.g., **99.99% uptime** and **<500ms** latency for the ML engine).
3.  **Core Logic Generation:** Implement **Prompt Layer 2** to generate high-quality Python code for core financial modules, specifically **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and **Tax-Loss Harvesting**.
4.  **Traceable Compliance:** Integrate prompts for security (MFA/Encryption) and compliance (PCI DSS Audit Checklist) to transform functionality into documented regulatory evidence.

## üß† Methodology: The Multi-Layer Prompt Strategy

The project's success is rooted in the **Financial Prompt Framework (FPF)**, which is organized into discrete, sequential layers to ensure that the output of one step becomes the validated input for the next.

| Layer | Focus Area | Role/Agent | Key Output |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1** | **Strategic Architecture** | Senior FinTech Architect | Microservices Diagram, Key Database Schemas, API Endpoints |
| **Layer 2** | **Core Financial Logic** | Quantitative Finance Engineer | Python code for MPT and Tax-Loss Harvesting modules |
| **Layer 3** | **Security & Compliance** | Security/Compliance Auditor | MFA/Encryption Implementation & PCI DSS Audit Checklist |
| **Layer 4** | **Testing & Validation** | QA/Testing Specialist | Stress Testing Framework for MPT results |

## üíª Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Prompt Orchestration:** Python (Google Gemini API, other LLM APIs)
* **Backend Frameworks:** Flask/Django (as generated by LLM)
* **Database & Caching:** PostgreSQL, Redis
* **Data Aggregation:** Plaid API Integration (as per architecture requirement)

## üí° Example: Layer 1 - Strategic Architecture Prompt

This is an excerpt of the initial, high-leverage prompt used to define the project's foundation. It mandates strict technical constraints and verifiable output formats.

```python
fintech_architecture_prompt = """
**ROLE:** Act as a Senior FinTech Architect, expert in building high-performance Robo-Advisory systems (Trading/ML) and strict regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, Zero Trust, OAuth 2.0).

**OBJECTIVE:** Design a complete, secure, and scalable Microservices architecture for a Personal Wealth Management application (Mint + Betterment).

## STRATEGIC REQUIREMENTS (FPF)
1. **Security/Availability Metric (SLA):** The architecture must guarantee **99.99% uptime** for the investment engine.
2. **Performance Metric (Latency):** The Expense Categorization Engine (ML) must process 95% of transactions in **less than 500 milliseconds**.
3. **Zero Trust Security:** Implement network segmentation, Hashicorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager, and **AES-256** encryption for data at rest.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTPUT
**Technologies:** Python (Backend/ML), Flask/Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Plaid API.
**Output Format:** Document structured in Markdown (NO code).

The document must include:
1. Descriptive Microservices Architecture Diagram.
2. Key Database Schemas (User, Transaction, Recommendation), detailing hashing (Bcrypt) and encrypted fields (AES-256).
