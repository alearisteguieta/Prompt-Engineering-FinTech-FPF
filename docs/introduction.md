# Introduction

## Real‑World Application

Personal wealth management that combines multi‑bank account aggregation (Mint‑style) with automated investment advisory (Betterment‑style). This portfolio repository showcases a concise, public view of the project’s architecture, methods, and key artifacts, aligned with the Financial Prompt Framework (FPF) and a Multi‑Layer Prompt Strategy.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Personal-Wealth-Management-App-Like-Mint-Betterment-279a56ae581780bb99b4cb0783b3a27d?pvs=21)[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Multi-Layer-Prompt-Structure-ZeTheta-Inter-279a56ae581780feba1aeea55bbace5b?pvs=21)

## Methodology

The project follows a structured prompt architecture sequence:

1. Meta Prompt
2. Financial Prompt Framework (FPF)
3. Multi‑Layer Prompt Strategy (Strategic → Development → Refinement)

This sequence ensures security‑by‑design, clear traceability from architecture to code, and testable outputs suitable for a FinTech context.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Breakdown-Structure-Task-279a56ae5817809fb32ac99177639cc1?pvs=21)[[4]](https://www.notion.so/Multi-Layer-Prompt-Structure-ZeTheta-Inter-279a56ae581780feba1aeea55bbace5b?pvs=21)

## Deliverables (Portfolio Scope)

- Prompt‑aligned documentation: high‑level architecture, API specification (summary), and core database schema
- Executable examples: MPT engine and a low‑latency expense categorization mock
- Testing & evolution: lightweight test plan, unit tests, results summary, and design evolution notes

Notes

- This repository is a condensed, portfolio‑style version of the full project. Sensitive or verbose materials are intentionally excluded.
- For the complete documentation and extended artifacts, use the “Complete Documentation” link in the repository README.
