# Introduction

## Real-World Application: Multi-bank account aggregation with automated investment advice

This project aims to deliver a complete **Python codebase** for a sophisticated real-world application that demonstrates the seamless integration of a **human-machine (AI) process** by leveraging the advanced capabilities of various language models such as **Chat GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, and Claude 4 Sonnet**.  

The implementation will focus on creating an **intuitive and secure user experience** for bank account aggregation. This work is part of the **Prompt Engineering internship at ZeTheta Algorithm Private Limited**, where advanced prompt engineering techniques will be applied to achieve optimal results.

## Methodology

The code development will rigorously follow the established **prompt architecture sequence**:

1. **Meta Prompt**  
2. **Financial Prompt Framework (FPF)**  
3. **Multilayer Prompt Strategy**  

This structured approach enables coherent interaction between the different components of the system.

## Objectives

Through the strategic combination of customized **Gemini 2.5 agents** and specialized projects from **Claude** and **Chat GPT-5**, the aim is to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of:

- **Accuracy**  
- **Security**  
- **End-user experience**  

---

## Deliverables

Additionally, the project will generate:

- A **Prompt Library** documenting all prompts used and their results.  
- A **practical application template** with implementation examples.  
- A **complete public repository** serving as a professional reference and portfolio piece developed during the internship.
